"""You are given a rectangular matrix mat[][] of size n x m, and your task is to return an 
array while traversing the matrix in spiral form.
Examples:
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10]
Explanation: 
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Explanation: Applying same technique as shown above.
Input: mat[][] = [[32, 44, 27, 23], [54, 28, 50, 62]]
Output: [32, 44, 27, 23, 62, 50, 28, 54]
Explanation: Applying same technique as shown above, output will be [32, 44, 27, 23, 
62, 50, 28, 54]."""
